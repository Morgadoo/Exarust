## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Trainer lesson
With a trainer hired, a night SHALL add 1000 divided by one plus the sum of the six skill levels to the first skill whose level is under 5 and whose technique at that level the trainer knows. The trainer knows a slot below the trainer's own level. A sum that reaches a new multiple of 5000 SHALL snap to it. A merchant, a physician, and a company with no trainer SHALL gain nothing.

#### Scenario: A known technique gains the lesson
- **WHEN** a combatant training technique 7 rests with a trainer who knows 7, the same combatant rests with a trainer who knows 3, a merchant and a physician training 7 rest with a trainer who knows 7, a combatant at 4500 rests with a matching trainer, a combatant whose other five skills are level 1 rests with a matching trainer, and a combatant whose first skill is level 5 rests while the second skill trains technique 9
- **THEN** the first word is 1000, the unmatched word stays 0, the merchant and the physician stay 0, 4500 snaps to 5000, the ranked word is 166, the level-5 word stays 25000, and the second skill becomes 166
