## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Creation variant step
Stepping SHALL read the variant from bits 20 through 23. Below 1 nothing SHALL change. Otherwise the variant SHALL fall by one and be written back into those bits, and when the widget is present its caption SHALL be the default at a new variant of 0 or the byte `(variant − 1) + 0x41`, then the refresh SHALL run.

#### Scenario: Step, default and absent widget
- **WHEN** the word variant is 2 and the widget is present
- **THEN** the word variant becomes 1 and the caption is A
- **WHEN** the word variant is 1 and the widget is present
- **THEN** the word variant becomes 0 and the caption is the default
- **WHEN** the word variant is 0
- **THEN** nothing changes
- **WHEN** the widget is absent
- **THEN** the word steps and no caption is chosen
