## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Combat stance
The system SHALL keep each fighter's stance, the looping clip it returns to. The player's SHALL be Idle out of combat mode, starting Idle only when the old stance's clip plays; in combat mode Cmbt - Idle while its target (the best within 5 m and 120° of the cursor) is nearer than 3.5 m × its body scale or within 3 s of its last attack, else, or dying, Defence stance. A clip played once SHALL end in the stance; a balanced fighter SHALL switch to it from looping clips but Cmbt - Idle and walks.

#### Scenario: Guard at the fight start
- **WHEN** `exarust --opponent play arenao1` starts without `--weapon`
- **THEN** the player raises its fists in the "Default" Defence stance, and drops to Cmbt - Idle once the duellist comes within 3.5 m

#### Scenario: Target leaves
- **WHEN** the player stands in Cmbt - Idle and its target moves beyond 3.5 m
- **THEN** its stance turns to the Defence stance but it keeps playing Cmbt - Idle

#### Scenario: After an attack
- **WHEN** the player attacks with no target within 3.5 m
- **THEN** the attack ends in Cmbt - Idle, its stance stays Cmbt - Idle for 3 s after the attack's last tick, and the clip stays Cmbt - Idle after that

#### Scenario: Combat mode off in the combat idle
- **WHEN** Tab turns combat mode off while the player plays Cmbt - Idle with the Defence stance
- **THEN** its stance turns to Idle and it keeps playing Cmbt - Idle until it walks

#### Scenario: Combat mode off in the stance's clip
- **WHEN** Tab turns combat mode off while the player plays the Defence stance, or Cmbt - Idle within 3 s of an attack
- **THEN** it starts Idle at once
