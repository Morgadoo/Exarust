## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Nearest morph index
Finding SHALL scan the points and keep the smallest distance to the given point, returning its index and distance. A NaN distance SHALL not replace. An empty list SHALL return −1 and the maximum float.

#### Scenario: Scan, ties and empty
- **WHEN** the point is 0, 0, 0 and the points are 1, 0, 0; 0, 2, 0 and 0, 0, 0.5
- **THEN** the index is 2 and the distance 0.25
- **WHEN** a distance is NaN
- **THEN** it does not replace the best
- **WHEN** the list is empty
- **THEN** the index is −1 and the distance is the maximum float
