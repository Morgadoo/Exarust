# Spec Delta

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Door wait
A walker not at a door SHALL stay as it is, door included. A door that lets the walker through SHALL move it past the door and let the search run. At exactly ten seconds the wait SHALL still hold. One millisecond later the walker SHALL seek again, clear the avoided node, and skip the cursor's low five bits. When both happen, seeking SHALL win and the search SHALL already be allowed. A start near the top of the clock SHALL not give up at a small now. Heading sway is not in this rule.

#### Scenario: Ten seconds still waits, the next millisecond seeks
- **WHEN** a walker already seeking meets a shut hinge one millisecond after ten seconds, a waiting walker meets a shut hinge at cursor 3 at exactly ten seconds and again one millisecond later, a waiting walker meets a slider at travel 0.29 at the start of the wait, that slider is met again at cursor 32 one millisecond after ten seconds, and a wait that started near the top of the clock meets the same slider at a small now
- **THEN** the seeking walker and its hinge stay as they were, the ten-second hinge is toggled open and the wait still holds with the search held and the avoided node kept, the next millisecond seeks with the avoided node cleared and bit 3 skipped while the search stays held and the hinge is not toggled again, the early slider moves the walker past the door and lets the search run without changing the door, the late slider seeks with the search allowed, the avoided node cleared and bit 0 skipped, and the wrapped clock moves past the door without seeking
