## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Dazed stance
While a fighter's energy is more than 0.05 under its most (in double precision), its stance SHALL be the Defence stance every body tick, and the player's stance rule SHALL not give Cmbt - Idle. Unless its condition is helpless or attacking, its clip SHALL start the Defence stance when another clip plays, with a blend of round((1.05 − E) × 300) frames, eased smoothly. A daze SHALL be decided before the posture stage in the same tick, so a fall's clip wins.

#### Scenario: Struck in the combat idle
- **WHEN** the player in combat mode, in Cmbt - Idle, is dazed to energy 0.62
- **THEN** its stance turns to the Defence stance, which starts with a blend of 129 frames, eased smoothly, and does not restart while the daze lasts

#### Scenario: Wits back
- **WHEN** the dazed player's energy is back within 0.05 of its most with its target near
- **THEN** its stance turns to Cmbt - Idle and the posture switch starts it with a blend of 30 frames

#### Scenario: Down or attacking
- **WHEN** a fighter down, getting up or attacking is dazed
- **THEN** its stance turns to the Defence stance and its clip plays on

#### Scenario: Duel
- **WHEN** `exarust --opponent --trace t.csv play arenao1` runs until the duellist kills the player
- **THEN** after each blow the player guards while dazed, and when its energy is back its targets turn under 0.5° a tick (10–18° in one tick without the daze's start)

#### Scenario: Shoved over
- **WHEN** `exarust --shove 60 --trace t.csv play arena` dazes the player to energy 0.13 and it falls
- **THEN** the Defence stance starts (blend 276), Rebalance and then the fall replace it each tick until the player is down, and the get-up ends in Idle without a jump

### Requirement: Stance blends
Each stance start SHALL blend from where the body is to the stance's first key: the set-stance helper (Tab, a duellist entering combat) 30 frames, smooth; the posture switch 30 frames, linear, once a Rebalance's wait has run out; a duellist's stance 40 frames without a primary striker, else twice its primary's stance blend, smooth, its ease set smooth on every pass even when nothing starts.

#### Scenario: Tab
- **WHEN** Tab turns combat mode off while the player plays the Defence stance
- **THEN** Idle starts with a blend of 30 frames, eased smoothly

#### Scenario: Posture switch
- **WHEN** a balanced fighter in Idle has the Defence stance
- **THEN** the Defence stance starts with a blend of 30 frames, linear

#### Scenario: Duellist
- **WHEN** a duellist holding a sword of stance blend 7, or with no primary striker, takes its stance from its combat walk
- **THEN** the stance starts with a blend of 14 frames, or 40, eased smoothly

#### Scenario: After a Rebalance
- **WHEN** a balanced fighter plays a Rebalance started off balance, its wait 41
- **THEN** the posture switch starts its stance on the 41st tick after it, not before
