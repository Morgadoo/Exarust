## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hire price
A hire SHALL cost 12 copper. Fewer than 12 SHALL refuse the hire and leave the copper and the roster unchanged. A full combatant roster or a second specialist SHALL refuse without spending. A hire that joins SHALL subtract 12 and add 12 to the amount spent.

#### Scenario: Eleven copper hires nobody
- **WHEN** a company with 11 copper tries to hire, and a company with 12 hires a combatant, then a physician, then a second physician
- **THEN** the first hire is refused with an empty roster and 11 copper, the combatant leaves 0 copper and 12 spent, and the second physician is refused with the spent total still 24
