## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Combat stance
The system SHALL keep each fighter's stance, the looping clip it returns to. The player's SHALL be Idle out of combat mode; in combat mode Cmbt - Idle while its target (the best fighter within 5 m and 120° of the cursor) is nearer than 3.5 m × its body scale or within 3 s of its last attack, else Defence stance, also while dying. A clip played once SHALL end in the stance; a balanced fighter SHALL switch to it from other looping clips but Cmbt - Idle and walks.

#### Scenario: Guard at the fight start
- **WHEN** `exarust --opponent play arenao1` starts without `--weapon`
- **THEN** the player raises its fists in the "Default" Defence stance, and drops to Cmbt - Idle once the duellist comes within 3.5 m

#### Scenario: Target leaves
- **WHEN** the player stands in Cmbt - Idle and its target moves beyond 3.5 m
- **THEN** its stance turns to the Defence stance but it keeps playing Cmbt - Idle

#### Scenario: After an attack
- **WHEN** the player attacks with no target within 3.5 m
- **THEN** the attack ends in Cmbt - Idle, its stance stays Cmbt - Idle for 3 s after the attack's last tick, and the clip stays Cmbt - Idle after that

### Requirement: Combat readiness
The system SHALL raise a fighter's readiness by 0.004 per tick, up to 1, while its stance and its clip are both Cmbt - Idle, and SHALL reset it to 0 otherwise. A blow SHALL scale the victim's penetration, impact and stab energy by 1 − 0.5 × its readiness, after the shove is taken from the impact.

#### Scenario: Ready for 3 s
- **WHEN** a fighter that has stood in Cmbt - Idle for 3 s takes a sword cut on bare flesh
- **THEN** the cut's penetration is half what it would be on a fighter in the Defence stance, and the shove is the same

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Duellist AI
The system SHALL drive an opponent from the start of the fight: it enters combat in the Defence stance, faces its target, approaches to striking distance and attacks at intervals with varied strikes, using the same animation and attack paths as the player. Its stance SHALL be the Defence stance at 4 reaches or more from its target and Cmbt - Idle within, its reach 60 cm plus its weapon's sweet spot, or 50 cm unarmed.

#### Scenario: Opponent engages
- **WHEN** `exarust play arena --opponent` starts
- **THEN** the opponent closes in and attacks the player

#### Scenario: Far and near
- **WHEN** `exarust --still-opponent --at 0,0,6 play arenao1` runs, then `--at 0,0,1.7`
- **THEN** the duellist guards in the Defence stance 8 m from the player, and stands in Cmbt - Idle at 3.7 m, within four reaches of its sword

### Requirement: Moveset from held items
The system SHALL pick a fighter's moveset from what it holds, in and out of combat mode, as the original: empty hands the race's own moveset (weapon class 0x80); one one-handed weapon "One Handed", two "2W Light"; a two-hander "Greatsword" for flags 0x521, "2H Light" with kind bit 0, else "Two Handed"; a polearm "Polearm"; a shield a shield moveset; an off-hand light "1H & Torch"; a main-hand light "Torch". A clip playing SHALL go on in the new moveset.

#### Scenario: Unarmed player
- **WHEN** `exarust --opponent play arena` runs without `--weapon`
- **THEN** the player fights with the "Default" moveset's guard and punches, and the duellist with its sword in "One Handed"

#### Scenario: Two-handers
- **WHEN** a fighter holds a two-handed weapon whose flags are 0x521, then one with kind 1, then one with kind 2
- **THEN** it fights with "Greatsword", then "2H Light", then "Two Handed", stance class 2 and weapon class 0x20 each time

#### Scenario: Torch beside a sword
- **WHEN** the player carries the torch with `--weapon ub05ssworda` in a story level
- **THEN** the torch is in the left hand and the player moves with "1H & Torch", stance class 4
