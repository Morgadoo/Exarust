# combat Specification

## Purpose
Resolves weapon attacks between fighters so the game's combat loop can be
played, as the base for the physically driven combat of the original.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Wielded weapons
The system SHALL hold a weapon model in a fighter's right hand so it follows the hand through every clip.

#### Scenario: Combat stance
- **WHEN** a character with `--weapon swordex01` plays the one-handed combat idle
- **THEN** the sword is held in the right fist with the blade forward and up

### Requirement: Weapon contacts
The system SHALL register at most one contact per attack and target, when the blade segment passes within a body part's volume during the attack's active window.

#### Scenario: Strike lands
- **WHEN** an opponent's attack sweeps its blade through the player's body
- **THEN** one hit on the nearest body part is reported

### Requirement: Damage and reactions
The system SHALL resolve each weapon contact by the original's damage model. The inputs are the weapon's stat record, where along the weapon and how fast the struck point met the part, and whether the blow was a stab. The blow passes through the struck part's two armour layers by a coverage roll, giving impact, crush, slash and pierce through padding and resistances. Part multipliers apply. The system SHALL take the yellow and red health bars accordingly, daze the victim, shove it on heavy impact, play a stagger reaction, and make the body go limp when yellow health falls below 0.01.

#### Scenario: Armour stops the edge
- **WHEN** a sword cut lands on a chest fully covered by plate
- **THEN** its penetration is less than a third of the same cut on bare flesh

#### Scenario: Knock-down
- **WHEN** a fighter's yellow health falls below 0.01
- **THEN** its body goes limp and falls under the blow, it stays down, and it is no longer attacked

### Requirement: Duellist AI
The system SHALL drive an opponent to face its target, approach to striking distance and attack at intervals with varied strikes, using the same animation and attack paths as the player.

#### Scenario: Opponent engages
- **WHEN** `exarust play arena --opponent` starts
- **THEN** the opponent closes in and attacks the player

### Requirement: Characters block each other
The system SHALL keep character bodies from passing through each other.

#### Scenario: Close quarters
- **WHEN** two characters move into each other
- **THEN** their capsules stop at contact

### Requirement: Factory weapons
The system SHALL assemble weapons named by factory recipes from their component models, choosing parts, shapes and materials from the item's seeds as the original does, and keeping an item's stored choices.

#### Scenario: Worked example
- **WHEN** the sword factory `sword_lnga1` generates with seeds 0x12345678 and quality 128
- **THEN** it chooses grip `sword grp m01`, guard `sword grd 17`, blade `sword bld dl02` and pommel `sword pml 11`, the pommel at −22.14 cm

### Requirement: Weapon stats
The system SHALL derive a weapon's stats from its item's weapon section. For a factory weapon it SHALL apply the recipe's variant bonuses and deform rules to the template's bytes, then scale them by the item's condition.

#### Scenario: Longer blade
- **WHEN** a blade part's Y-scale deform grows the blade by a factor 1.2
- **THEN** the weapon's weight byte is multiplied and its balance byte divided by 1.2, rounded

### Requirement: Armour
The system SHALL give each body part two armour layers: the race's natural layer, then the worn items in order, folding the older outer layer inwards by effective coverage. Each item's protection is scaled by its condition.

#### Scenario: Two shirts
- **WHEN** a character wears two mail shirts covering 80 % of a part
- **THEN** the inner layer has full coverage and the first shirt's slash resistance at its effective coverage, and the second shirt is the outer layer
