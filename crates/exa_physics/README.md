# `exa_physics`

Rigid-body and articulated-body simulation: the core of Exanima's feel (physically driven characters, momentum-based combat, cloth).

**Phase:** Phase 3 (see [`docs/PLAN.md`](../../docs/PLAN.md)). Status: started — the original's
body solver (`body`), its level contacts (`contact`) and the character controller (`lib`).

Each fixed tick (83 Hz) moves the character controllers, then runs the
character ticks (`body::CharacterTicks`, filled by `exa_game`: clips sampled
and targets set, player last), then the body solver over every awake body
(`body::BodySystems`). Blows are queued for the next tick, and parts are
drawn between their last two ticks (`body::BodyPlugin`). Every part is
pinned at its origin to its parent, and the skeleton's links bound each
joint's range (`body::Ragdoll::new`); a limp body's links also damp each
joint inside its range through their smoothed lengths, reset when the
body goes limp (`body::Ragdoll::go_limp`). In a living body every slack
link is a link muscle that turns its joint toward the clip's angle, with
the gains the character tick sets from what the character does
(`body::Bearing`) and its race (`body::RaceMuscles`) (`src/body_muscle.rs`);
a pose drive turns the pelvis, spine, head and feet toward the clip's
orientation about each part's own origin, scaled by the support S²
(`body::Drive`); and the carry holds the body up in place of gravity, with
a lift servo holding its pelvis at a target height over the ground under
its feet (`src/body_lift.rs`). The pose is put on the original's character
frame, whose origin follows the pelvis by its rules: on the pelvis while
moving, frozen while standing steady, behind dead-bands of 5 and 10 cm
otherwise (`src/body_frame.rs`, `body::Drive::anchor`). The controller
carries a standing body only across the ground and turns it, holds its
pelvis horizontally over the frame's until the original's support pins do,
and follows the frame (`CharacterBody::follow`, a tenth of the way a step,
at most 2 cm), leaving its follow out of the carry. Until the feet step and
the legs bend, a stopgap of Exarust's own reads each foot's ground no lower
than the grounded controller's floor less 6 cm, so a body climbs the steps
its capsule climbs (`src/body_climb.rs`).
Each character tick measures a living body's balance at its chest against
its ankles and asks the level for the ground under each foot
(`contact::Level::height_below`, the original's Height Query), which give
its support S (`src/body_balance.rs`, `body::Ragdoll::measure_balance`).
Velocity retention is the original's default environment: banded by speed
for limp parts, the fast value for living limbs. A limp body sleeps by the
original's countdown (`body::Ragdoll::countdown`: 256, two off each tick
under 20 cm/s, held at 30–32 between 20 and 40 cm/s, back to 256 above)
and is woken by a blow or by going limp; a living body never sleeps.
A dazed or unsteady body's targets give way to the pose it holds by the
original's weight (`body::Drive::hold_weight`), which the character tick
hands to the sampler; the race's clip rates (`body::RaceMuscles`) set its
clip clock.

The debug tools' measures are in `body::inspect` (`src/body_inspect.rs`):
each joint's turn from its rest turn (stored when the body is built,
`Ragdoll::with_rest_turns`) split into a swing of the bone axis and a twist
about it, its distance from the clip's turn, each link's gap against its
slack, the range a joint's slack links use, its pivot's gap, and where
parts, links and anchors are drawn. `body::DealtShoves` keeps the blows the
last tick dealt. Nothing calls them unless a tool is on
([`docs/DEBUGGING.md`](../../docs/DEBUGGING.md)).

## Scope

- Fixed-timestep deterministic simulation set, independent of frame rate.
- Rigid bodies (props, doors, items), collision against level geometry and convex hulls.
- Articulated character bodies driven by joint motors toward animation targets (active ragdoll / 'motile' dynamics).
- Cloth and padded-armour layers (original engine has cloth classes per material: basic, fine, padded, silk, velvet).
- Decision recorded in docs/plan: rapier3d for level colliders and the character controller; the
  body solver and its level contacts are in-house, as the original's (`docs/formats/RSQ.md`).
